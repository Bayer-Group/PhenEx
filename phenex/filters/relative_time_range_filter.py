class RelativeTimeRangeFilter(Filter):
    """
    This class filters events in an EventTable based on a specified time range relative to an anchor date.
    The anchor date can either be provided by an anchor phenotype or by an 'INDEX_DATE' column in the
    EventTable.

    Attributes:
        min_days (Optional[int]): Minimum number of days from the anchor date to filter events. This
            option is mutually exclusive with min_years.
        max_days (Optional[int]): Maximum number of days from the anchor date to filter events. This
            option is mutually exclusive with max_years.
        min_years (Optional[Value]): Minimum number of years from the anchor date to filter events. This
            option is mutually exclusive with min_days.
        max_years (Optional[Value]): Maximum number of years from the anchor date to filter events.
            This option is mutually exclusive with max_days.
        anchor_phenotype (Phenotype): A phenotype providing the anchor date for filtering.
        when (Optional[str]): when can be "before" or "after"; if "before", days prior to anchor
            event_date are positive, and days after are negative; using after, days before the
            anchor event_date are negative and days after the anchor event_date are positive.
            So
                * max_days = Value('<', 365)
                * min_days = Value('>', 0)
                * when = 'before',
            means between 0 and 365 days before anchor event_date (excluding endpoints), where 'after'
            means between 0 and 365 days after.

    Methods:
        _filter(table: EventTable) -> EventTable:
            Filters the given EventTable based on the specified time range relative to the anchor date.
            Parameters:
                table (EventTable): The table containing events to be filtered.
            Returns:
                EventTable: The filtered EventTable with events within the specified time range.
    Filters an EventTable relative to some reference date.
