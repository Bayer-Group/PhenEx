class ContinuousCoveragePhenotype(Phenotype):
    """
    A phenotype based on continuous coverage within an observation period.

    This class helps generate SQL queries to filter a population based on
    continuous coverage criteria within the observation period.

    :param domain: The domain of the phenotype, default is 'observation_period'. The domain
        key is used at runtime to determine which table to run on.
    :param coverage_period_min: The minimum coverage period for the phenotype with a default
        of 0 days. The operator must be '>=' or '>'.
    :param return_date: An optional return date for the phenotype result. Possible values are
        "first" and "last", where "first" is the beginning of the coverage period containing
        the index date and "last" in the end of the coverage period containing the index date.

    Example usage: Find all patients with at least 90 days of continuous coverage
    --------------
    >>> coverage_min_filter = ValueFilter(">=", 90)
    >>> phenotype = ContinuousCoveragePhenotype(coverage_period_min=coverage_min_filter)
