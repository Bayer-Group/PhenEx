    "# Python for Phenex Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people who are doing observational studies do not consider themselves coders/programmers and primarily see themselves as epidemiologists, guided by a research question at hand. Among those doing observational research who do program, R or even SAS are often used, and common data science languages such as python are not often used. This is in large part due to the fact that tools for observational research are historically written in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "PhenEx is designed to reflect the thought processes of doing observational research with real world data. This means that many epidemiologists find themselves very quickly able to read a PhenEx cohort specificition without any python knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, to write PhenEx cohorts from scratch (rather than copy and paste), it is useful to know some of the basics of python programming. We have collected here some notes and solutions from teaching PhenEx to python beginners, with simple explanations and links to resources to dive deeper into a topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is by no means exhaustive and simply a starting point! As with all tutorials, it is hard to determine the level of the reader. We have tried to create this for total beginners, though that is difficult. It is important, for complete beginners, to not be overwhelmed! At the beginning, programming can seem overly complicated or magical, but it is important to remember that it is definitely not magical, and shockingly simple once understood."

    "Syntax highlighting means that different programmatic entities are different colors. This makes reading and writing code much easier! Suggested text editors are [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [zed](https://zed.dev/), and for a more fully featured IDE (integrated development environment) you can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Also, jupyter notebooks are highly recommended, as you can then interact with your data (i.e. see the output immediately). Notebooks also provide basic syntax highlighting.

    "## Variables\n",
    "Variables are known from algebra. In the expression `x = 3`, *x* is a variable that is assigned the value 3. We can then use *x* in later expressions, and it maintains its value, for example `y = x + 5`, *y* is then assigned the value of 8. This seemingly trivial concept is used extensively in programming languages. In the case of PhenEx, will be using variables extensively. There are two important reasons for using variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, if you use some PhenEx component in more than one place, it is recommended to assign a variable to that component and then use the variable name in all places it is used. This is good for reducing errors when you need to make a change; if you need to change that component, you only need to change it in one place, and not in multiple places. For example, if we decided that we wanted to change our *one_year_pre_index* definition to NOT included the index date (day 0), we would simply have to change it in the definition of the variable *one_year_pre_index*, and this change would apply to everywhere where that variable is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to use variables is to make your code easier to read. Phenotypes can become quite complicated, with many PhenEx components being used, for example, for codelists, relative time range filters, categorical filters, anchor phenotypes and so on. We can use variables to break our code down easily readable parts. As an illustration of how long PhenEx code can get, let us revisit the definition of phenotype1 from above, but this time NOT use the variable *one_year_pre_index* as was done above; notice that the relative_time_range does NOT use the variable, and instead defines the RelativeTimeRangeFilter within the definition of the CodelistPhenotype."

    "Now we know that variables exist and we can assign them values using an equal sign. But what can those values be? In the above example, we set `x=3` and we also saw things like `phenotype1 = CodelistPhenotype(...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "When programming, it is important to know that variables have a *datatype*. Other programming languages make this very explicit, and in those languages you have to state what datatype a variable is. In python, a variable's datatype is implicit. By implicit, that means that we do not state a variables datatype, even though it has one! Depending on what datatype a variable is, we can do different things with it. PhenEx provides many different datatypes for you to use (e.g. CodelistPhenotype is a datatype). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several built-in datatypes provided by the python language itself that you should be familiar with. To use PhenEx we need to be able recognize, manipulate, and finally create these built in datatypes. This is for the most part not too difficult! These built-in datatypes are :\n",
    "- **int** : integer values i.e. non-decimal numbers\n",
    "- **float** : decimal numbers\n",
    "- **boolean** : `True` or `False`\n",
    "- **string** : a string of characters! recognizable by single or double quotations e.g. \"this is a string\" or 'this is a string'\n",
    "- **list** : a list of other datatypes, starting/ending with square brackets, items separated by commas e.g. [1,2,3]\n",
    "- **dictionary** : key value pairs, starting/ending with curly brackets, pairs separated by colon, items separated by commas, e.g. {\"a\":\"value1\"}\n",
    "- **none type** : meaning no value is passed, use the capital `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of them are fairly easy to recognize; integer numbers and decimal numbers are very straightforward. The booleans are also easy; we just need to remember that we capitalize True or False. Similarly, if we want to be explicit that we are not setting a value, we can use the none-type which is just a capital None. String datatypes are also relatively straightforward; we just need to remember to use either single or double quotation marks at the begining or end of the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "The list and dictionary are a bit more complicated, but once mastered, are incredibly powerful. A list (called an array in most other languages) is simply an ordered list of things. Lists in python can contain anything you want to - the contents of a list do not need to have the same data type (this is not the case in most other programming languages). Remember, to recognize a list you look for square brackets and commas."

    "In PhenEx, we need to be careful of scope when defining variables that should be reused. For example, we may want to use the variable *one_year_pre_index* in multiple functions, such as in the functions *create_inclusion_criteria* and *create_baseline_characteristics*. If we want it to be available to both of these functions but only want to define it once, we have two options :\n",

    "PhenEx is a python library that provides many components to create a cohort. To use PhenEx, you first need to install it, and then you need to import the components you want to use. Import statements can be anywhere in a file, but it is recommended to keep them at the top of your file. Then, for each PhenEx component you want to use, you import it. Look into the PhenEx documentation for where to import things from. "
