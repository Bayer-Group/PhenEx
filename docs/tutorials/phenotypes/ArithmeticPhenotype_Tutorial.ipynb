    "\n",
    "There are two obvious use cases for this in RWD :\n",
    "1. calculating medical scores, such as the CHADSVASC score or the Charlson Comorbidity Index\n",
    "2. calculating a derived measurement value, such as Body Mass Index, which is calculated using height and weight.\n",

    "Like the LogicPhenotype, the Arithmetic phenotype operates on other phenotypes; we refer to the phenotypes that an ArithmeticPhenotype operates on the 'component phenotypes'. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform arithmetic, we need to associate a value to patients fulfilling criteria of a component phenotype. By default, this is done by associating the value of '1' with all patients that fulfill the criteria of a component phenotype. Patients that do not fulfill the component phenotype criteria are associated with a value of '0'. \n",
