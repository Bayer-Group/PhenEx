    "### Step 3 : Define time ranges\n",
    "It is very common in RWD studies to want to know if a medical code occurred within some time period of interest. To define time ranges, we pass an instance of the RelativeTimeRangeFilter class to a CodelistPhenotype using the *time_range_filter* keyword argument. \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RelativeTimeRangeFilter with index date as anchor\n",
    "\n",
    "In RWD studies, the most common anchor date is the index date of each patient. For example :\n",
    "- the time range for baseline characteristics is some time period, referred to as the **baseline period, prior to index date**\n",
    "- the time range for outcomes is some time period, referred to as the **followup period, after the index date**\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that time range filters used to define phenotypes for all baseline charactersitics and all outcomes will use the index date as the anchor date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is so common to use the index date as the anchor, the default anchor for RelativeTimeRangeFilter is the index date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note :** The components of EntryPhenotype must define an anchor phenotype (see below), as no index date has been defined! Only after an entry phenotype has been defined do subsequent phenotypes have access to the (possible) index date. See the tutorial on EntryPhenotype for more details."

    "- ***all*** will return the date of all events that fulfill the CodelistPhenotype criteria. Note that there are multiple rows per patient in this case (no reduction). All other arguments return a single row per patient.\n",
    "- ***first*** will return the date of the first occurrence of a code in the codelist\n",
    "- ***last*** will return the date of the last occurrence of the code in the codelist\n",
    "- ***nearest*** will return the date of the occurrence of the code in the codelist nearest to the anchor date of the time_range_filter. Note that *time_range_filter* must be defined to use *nearest*. If multiple time range filters are defined (i.e. *time_range_filter* is a list), the anchor is taken from the first time range filter in the list"
