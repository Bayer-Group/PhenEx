    "### Step 4 : Define value_aggregation\n",
    "Till now, the value_filters we have seen perform filtering on the entries recorded directly in the event tables. However, it is common to want to perform filtering on some aggregation of the data found in our event tables. In these cases, we can think of the measurement events in our data as 'raw' values that do not directly actually reflect the definition of a measurement we are interested in. For example, \n",
    "- Blood Pressure fluctulates very rapidly and changes over time; I therefore do not trust a single, or even multiple values. I may want to define 'hypertension' as not just a single measurement event of systolic blood pressure greater than 160; instead, I may want want to perform value filtering on the 'mean systolic blood pressure in the one year pre index period'. Notice that this requires an aggregation of the 'raw' event based data in the one year pre-index period, meaning that our definition of 'systolic blood pressure' is not that recorded in the raw data, but rather the 'mean SBP in the one year pre index period'. After this aggregation is performed, we then want to perform the value filtering to find those with a 'mean SBP in the one year pre index period' > 160.\n",
    "- Another common issue is that we often see duplicated entries for a lab measurement performed on the same day. For instance, a systolic blood pressure measurement may be performed 10 times on one day. This is often an issue of data quality, and it is suggested to have pipelines to de-duplicate values. However, we can use *MeasurementPhenotype* to perform this de-duplication for us. In essence, we create a new definition for systolic blood pressured which could be called 'daily_median_systolic_blood_pressure', and then perform further value_filtering on this new aggregated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform value aggregation, we use the *value_aggregation* keyword argument. The options for value_aggregation are the obvious mean, median, min and max, which perform the named aggregation on all values defined by the *CodelistPhenotype* arguments i.e. codelist criteria, time_range_filters and categorical_filters.\n",

    "### Step 6: Define cleaning value filters\n",
    "RWD sources are often quite messy; measurement values are often manually entered and thus we see typos and obviously faulty data in our measurement tables. MeasurementPhenotype allows us to ignore obviously faulty data using the clean_nonphysiologicals_value_filter. This filter works prior to value_aggregation, so that obviously erroneous data does not enter our value aggregation and final results. First define what physiological thresholds look like. Take care when defining these physiological thresholds as RWD sources, while messy, are also very large; rare physiological outliers are therefore 'common'."
