# PhenEx Application

This directory contains the full-stack web application for PhenEx, including the backend API, frontend UI, and supporting infrastructure.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The PhenEx application consists of several components:

- **Backend**: FastAPI-based REST API (`/backend`) with Python support for PhenEx phenotype extraction
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript application (`/ui`) for interactive cohort building and data visualization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase for authentication and data management
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose orchestration with supporting services (Kong API Gateway, Supabase Studio)

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the PhenEx application running locally:

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- At least 4GB of available RAM

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bayer-Group/PhenEx.git
   cd PhenEx/app
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit the `.env` file and fill in any missing fields, particularly:

   - Database passwords and secrets
   - API keys for external services (OpenAI, Snowflake, etc.)
   - User-specific configuration values

   **Important**: Never commit the actual `.env` file with real credentials to version control.

3. **Start the application**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This command will:

   - Build and start all required services
   - Initialize the PostgreSQL database with PhenEx schemas
   - Start the backend API server on port 8001
   - Start the frontend development server on port 5173
   - Launch Supabase Studio for database management

4. **Set up initial database**

   ```bash
   bash backend/scripts/reset-databases-local.sh
   ```

   This initializes the database schemas needed for the application to start properly.

### üåê Accessing the Application

Once all services are running (this may take a few minutes on first startup):

- **Supabase Studio**: http://localhost:8000 (database management interface)
- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8001
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8001/docs (FastAPI Swagger docs)

### üë§ Test User Login

To explore the application features, you can log in using the pre-configured test user:

- **Email**: `test@phenex.ai`
- **Password**: `12345678`

This test user has access to sample data and pre-built cohorts that demonstrate PhenEx's capabilities for phenotype extraction and cohort building.

## üîß Development

### Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Key files:

- `backend/.env` - Backend API configuration (database connections, API keys)
- Root `.env` - Docker Compose environment variables

### Development Mode

The Docker Compose setup is configured for development with:

- **Hot reload**: Both frontend and backend automatically restart when code changes
- **Volume mounting**: Local code is mounted into containers for live development
- **Debug ports**: Exposed for debugging and testing

### Stopping the Application

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove all data (complete reset)
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

## üì¶ Services Overview

| Service        | Purpose                             | Port  | Health Check |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----- | ------------ |
| `backend-dev`  | FastAPI backend with PhenEx library | 8001  | Manual       |
| `frontend-dev` | React/Vite development server       | 5173  | Manual       |
| `db`           | PostgreSQL database                 | 54322 | Automatic    |
| `auth`         | Supabase Auth (GoTrue)              | -     | Automatic    |
| `meta`         | PostgreSQL metadata API             | -     | -            |
| `kong`         | API Gateway                         | 54321 | -            |
| `studio`       | Supabase Studio UI                  | 54323 | Automatic    |

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Persistence

- **Database data**: Persisted in `./volumes/db/data`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 5173, 8001, 54321-54323 are available
2. **Memory issues**: Docker requires sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure Docker has permission to mount volumes

### Logs and Debugging

```bash
# View logs for all services
docker compose logs

# View logs for specific service
docker compose logs backend-dev

# Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs -f frontend-dev
```

### Reset Everything

If you encounter persistent issues:

```bash
# Complete reset (removes all data!)
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
rm -rf volumes
cp -r _init_volumes volumes
docker compose up
```

## üß™ Testing

The application includes test suites for both frontend and backend components. Tests can be run within the Docker containers or locally with appropriate dependencies installed.
